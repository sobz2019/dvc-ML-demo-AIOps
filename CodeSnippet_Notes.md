##  Code Snippet -1
```python

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("--config", "-c", default="config/config.yaml")

parsed_args = parser.parse_args()

get_data(config_path=parsed_args.config)

```
### Explanation

1. Creating an Argument Parser:
```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

```

argparse.ArgumentParser() is used to create a new argument parser object.
This object will hold information about the arguments the program accepts, how to parse them, and how to generate help and error messages.

2. Adding an Argument:

```python
parser.add_argument("--config", "-c", default="config/config.yaml")
```

parser.add_argument("--config", "-c", ...) tells the parser to expect an argument --config or its shorthand -c.

--config and -c are command-line options. The user can specify either --config or -c followed by a value (the path to the configuration file).

default="config/config.yaml" specifies that if the user does not provide the --config or -c option, it will default to "config/config.yaml".

3. Parsing the Command-Line Arguments:

```python
parsed_args = parser.parse_args()
```

parser.parse_args() processes the command-line arguments and returns an object (parsed_args) with attributes corresponding to the expected arguments.

If the user provided --config or -c followed by a value, parsed_args.config will be set to that value.

If the user did not provide these options, parsed_args.config will be set to the default value "config/config.yaml".

4. Calling the get_data Function:

```python
get_data(config_path=parsed_args.config)
```

get_data(config_path=parsed_args.config) calls the get_data function, passing the value of parsed_args.config as the config_path argument.
This means the function will use the configuration file specified by the user or the default configuration file if none was specified.

### How It Works
When you run the script from the command line, you can specify a configuration file using the --config or -c option. For example:

```bash
python script.py --config custom_config.yaml
```
If you do not provide the --config or -c option, the script will use the default configuration file:

```bash
python script.py
```
In this case, config_path will be set to "config/config.yaml".

## DVC

```
The dvc repro command you executed is part of the Data Version Control (DVC) tool, which is used to manage machine learning projects. This command helps in reproducing the pipeline stages defined in your DVC pipeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what happened during the execution of dvc repro and what each step signifies:

```
## Generating and Updating the Lock File:
```
Generating lock file 'dvc.lock'
Updating lock file 'dvc.lock'
```
DVC generates or updates the dvc.lock file, which locks the current state of the data and pipeline stages. This ensures reproducibility by recording the exact state of the data and code dependencies.

dvc repro: Reproduces the specified pipeline stages, runs the associated commands, and updates the state of the project.
Script Execution: The script src/stage_01_load_save.py was executed, fetching data, creating directories, and saving data.
Lock File: DVC generated/updated the dvc.lock file to ensure reproducibility.
Git Integration: Suggestions were made to add generated files to Git and enable auto-staging.
Remote Storage: Reminded to use dvc push to upload changes to remote storage


## why we need to add - git add 'artifacts\raw_local_dir\.gitignore' dvc.lock

Adding the .gitignore file and the dvc.lock file to Git using git add 'artifacts/raw_local_dir/.gitignore' dvc.lock is essential for maintaining a reproducible and clean project structure when using DVC. Here's why each of these files needs to be tracked by Git:

.gitignore

The .gitignore file ensures that certain files or directories are ignored by Git and not included in the version control. In the context of DVC, .gitignore is used to ignore large data files that are tracked by DVC instead of Git.

Why add .gitignore to Git?

Prevent Large Files from Being Tracked by Git:

Data files, especially large ones, should not be tracked by Git because Git is not designed for handling large files efficiently.
The .gitignore file in the artifacts/raw_local_dir directory will typically contain patterns that match data files (e.g., *.csv, *.data) to ensure they are ignored by Git.

Ensure Consistency Across Environments:

By committing the .gitignore file to the repository, you ensure that other collaborators or environments also ignore the same files.
This prevents accidental addition of large files to the repository by different team members or during automated processes.
dvc.lock
The dvc.lock file is automatically generated or updated by DVC whenever you run commands like dvc repro. This file captures the exact state of the data, code, and pipeline dependencies at the time of execution.

### Why add dvc.lock to Git?

<b>Reproducibility:<b>

The dvc.lock file contains hash values and other metadata that ensure the exact versions of data and dependencies are used.
Committing this file ensures that anyone cloning the repository and running the pipeline can reproduce the exact same results.

Dependency Tracking:

The dvc.lock file records the state of dependencies for each pipeline stage.
This includes input and output file hashes, command details, and any parameters that affect the pipeline's execution.

Pipeline Integrity:

By tracking dvc.lock, you ensure the integrity of the pipeline over time. Changes to the data or code will be reflected in updates to this file, providing a clear history of the project's evolution.

### Summary

.gitignore:

Prevents large files from being tracked by Git.
Ensures consistency across different environments and team members.
Helps maintain a clean and efficient Git repository.

dvc.lock:

Ensures reproducibility of the pipeline.
Tracks the exact state of data and dependencies.
Maintains pipeline integrity and provides a clear history of changes.
